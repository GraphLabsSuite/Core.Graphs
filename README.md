### Installation
* npm install graphlabs.core.graphs

* (for testing only):
    * npm install -g mocha
    * npm install -g ts-node

### For contributors
* install Node, npm/yarn, WebStorm/Intellij IDEA
* look at package.json file to see how to run tests
* do not forget to update version before publishing
* while contributing, write maximum comments
* add specification tags of JSDoc to every function and class you have created
* seek to write tests over every functionality you adds to the module

### Content
* JSON types
    * GraphJSON - representation of the whole graph in JSON format
    * VertexJSON - representation of the vertex in JSON format
    * EdgeJSON - representation of the edge in JSON format

* Interfaces
    * IGraph - interface for working with graph functions
    * IVertex - interface for working with vertex functions
    * IEdge - interface for working with edge functions
    * IWeightedEdge - interface for working with weighted edges

* Main classes
    * Vertex
        * isAdjacent - checks whether the second vertex is adjacent to the given one
        * isIncident - checks whether the edge is incident to the given vertex
    * Edge
        * isIncident - checks whether the vertex is incident to the given edge
    * UndirectedEdge
    * DirectedEdge
    * DirectedWeightedEdge
    * Graph
        * addEdge - adds the edge to the graph
        * removeEdge - removes the edge from the graph
        * getEdge - gets the edge by the vertices incident to it
        * addVertex - adds the vertex to the graph
        * removeVertex - removes the vertex to the graph
        * getVertex - gets the vertices by the name requested
        * union - returns the result of union operation with another graph
        * unionN - static extension of union operation for N graphs
        * intersect - returns the result of intersect operation with another graph
        * intersectN - static extension of intersect operation for N graphs
        * complement - returns a complement graph to the given one
        * buildSCC - returns strongly connected components of the graph
        * print - prints the graph to the console
        * toString - returns the string view of the graph
        * clone - returns a deep clone of the graph
    * UndirectedGraph
        * buildMDS - returns minimal dominating sets of the graph
    * DirectedGraph
    * DirectedWeightedGraph

* Auxiliary classes
    * GraphToJSONConverter - converts graph to JSON format and controversially
    * VertexToJSONConverter - converts vertex to JSON format and controversially
    * EdgeToJSONConverter - converts edge to JSON format and controversially
    * GraphSerializer
        * serialize - returns string representation of the graph
        * deserialize - returns graph from its string representation
    * GraphGenerator
        * generate - generates an instance of Graph type with random vertex and edge numbers
